# System Identification and Cascade PID Controller Design of a Spinbath Circulation Process
This paper develops a modeling and control system design framework to enhance the robustness of a spinbath circulation process.
The dynamics of the spinbath process is first modeled based on historical data of the steady-state operation using the grey box modeling approach.
By taking into account the concepts from fluid mechanics, linearized at equilibrium points, and represented as a second-order transfer function with time delay. Its parameters are estimated using curve fitting and optimization methods.
The system dynamics model is obtained by combining the dynamic component models, which are then validated, achieving a fit value of 86.7382%.
Three control system configurations are designed: single-loop, conventional cascade, and summed-setpoint cascade.
Simulation results from the process of shutdown and activating the evaporator demonstrate deviations in solution height in the head tank due to changes in the evaporator inlet flow rate setpoint.
In automatic mode, the control system in the summed-setpoint cascade configuration maintains the solution height in the head tank better than the single-loop configuration, achieving a 61.29% smaller peak error and 67.84% smaller IAE.
The proposed control system implementation could improves the quality of the final product while reducing monitoring burdens and minimizing the potential for human error.
